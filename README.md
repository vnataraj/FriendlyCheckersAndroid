FriendlyCheckersAndroid
=======================

Port of FriendlyCheckers to Android. 

The plan is to add networking functionality this time. 

architecture:
  refactor layered game system for better client/gamemaster separation of concerns.

features: 
  networking 
  facebook login?
  build layers to make it easy to make facebook login, networked FriendlyChess, FriendlyTwitter etc.
  do we really need an AI? perhaps the focus of this one should be multiplayer.
  if we allow people to play together, we should make it easy for them to chat. can we hook into fb chat system?
